will add specific instructions on setting up database/server in future, if needed
- database is hosted on localhost:81 with MAMP for testing
- the server and client are two separate unity projects, start the server before starting the client. multiple instances of the clients may be opened
- the server does not need to be online in order to register
- both the server and database must be online in order to login and test chat functionality
- the key generator is for when we want to start handing out game keys for early alpha multiplayer testing (not for a while, need to pay for hosting :c)
